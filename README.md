- Navigating through documentation to grasp the setup process.

## Implementation Insights:
- Ensured comprehensive commenting in the codebase for better comprehension and maintainability.
- Shared `creds.json` file openly for testing purposes during the development phase.
- Implemented error handling for various scenarios during authorization and step count data retrieval.

## Technical Requirements:

- Languages and Libraries:
  - JavaScript
  - React.js
  - Express.js
  - Node.js
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
